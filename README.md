Finding Correlations Of Common Gene Expressions Of Multiple Genetic Diseases By Using Microarray Data

Abstractâ€”The gene regulatory network (GRN) reveals the
regulatory relationships among genes and can provide a systematic
understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying biological
processes. The idea studied here is to compare traditional analysis of
microarray gene expression profiles and network analysis of GRN
inferred using gene expression data. The target is to find, if there is,
common gene patterns effective genetic diseases. In this work we
applied statistical analysis and clustering methods like k-means and
random forest to find common structures among disease gene
profiles. The same data is used to create a GRN network and network
theory methods applied to find network statistics to inspect
underlying mechanism of gene regulatory network for genetic
diseases.
